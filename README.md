# Automated IP Access Management with Python

Algorithm to Update Restricted Access Lists in a Healthcare Environment.

- In this 30-minute graded Coursera assignment, I developed a Python algorithm to automate updates to an employee allow list for restricted network access. The project involved reading, parsing, and modifying files containing IP addresses, ensuring employees with revoked access were efficiently removed from the allow list.

- I implemented Python functions such as open(), .read(), .write(), .split(), and .join(), and constructed a for loop with conditional logic to identify and remove unauthorized IP addresses. This process allowed me to streamline access management , reduce human error, and gain practical experience in automating cybersecurity tasks using Python.

- Through this activity, I enhanced my problem-solving, coding, and file-handling skills , learned best practices for documenting code, and prepared a portfolio-ready project to demonstrate technical competency to prospective employers.
